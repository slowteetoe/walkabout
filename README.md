This is a hack for the Las Vegas Hack / 2013 National Day of Civic Hacking hackathon.

Ever been curious about what's going on around you?  What businesses are going in?  What businesses are moving out (or aren't current with their business licence)?

This aims to scratch that itch - we'll pull the business licence data from the City of Las Vegas for nearby locations and display it to you.
